            <h4>What is machine learning</h4>
            <p>
                Since the beginning of time humans where good at certain things. They learned, read and acted on
                things.
                But because of the internet, the web has also developed a certain brain. They now can read, and
                render
                things we struggled when growing up. The machine doesn’t have the struggles of reading anymore, when
                we
                humans are start from scratch.

                The use of Artificial Intelligence(AI) are no secrets anymore, there are enough self driving cars,
                or
                scanning products. The computer is learning these things and it mostly recognize patterns.

                Not only that, the machine are also listening. Freaky right?
                Well how else are you auto generate Closed Captions on Youtube. It’s not the best at the moment, but
                it
                has come from far away and has some good things to it.

                The machine learns a lot by using big Data. Data is where everything comes from. It’s the key for
                Machine Learning(ML).
            </p>


            <h4>Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence</h4>
            <p>
                AI systems are more close to human decisions. This includes certain things they can, problem
                solving,
                planning, learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, perception, motion and manipulation.

                However, ML is a data analytic technique where computer learns how to do natural things from humans
                or
                animals. It learns, or read a certain thing and show results from the data. It helps the user by
                giving
                insights from the data.
            </p>


            <h4> How does ML works?</h4>
            <p>
                ML has two types of techniques: Supervised learning, which trains a model on known input and output.
                Unsupervised learning which finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structure is input data

            </p>


            <h5>Supervised learning</h5>
            <p>
                The computer is exposed to big amount of data with labels, for example data about medicines. The
                computer needs to recognize the pixels and patterns from a picture and the create number or strings
                that
                later then can be used to search up in the database.
                With this human task are made easier.

            </p>


            <h5>Unsupervised learning</h5>
            <p>
                Using Unsupervised learning is mainly for identifying patterns in the data. It’s more categorized
                which
                spots similarities and cluster this together. Google uses this to group certain thing together like
                stories and similar topics. These patterns are hidden and would take a lot of time when trying to
                figure
                it yourself out. Or cellphone companies sorted by locations.

            </p>

            <h4> Machine Learning with basic knowledge of Javascript</h4>
            <p>
                Can I build something that needs ML without work experience of 10 years?

            </p>
            <p>
                This research if for those who are interested in building a project that uses ML. The steps are
                quite
                intensive if you don’t know the basics of Javascript or working on a server. So if this is the case,
                work on your Javascript and start building with Nodejs.

            </p>


            <h5>But we are technies what do we need?</h5>
            <p>
                You need data. Look at your case, what do you want your machine to do? Does it need to analyze
                images or
                does it need to read text from a picture. There is a lot of use cases and you just need to find a
                library for Javascript.
            </p>



            <ul>
                A few I came across are:
                <li> <a href="https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/">tesseractJS</a>
                    for reading text</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js/demos">TensorFlow</a>
                    for basically everything from image to text.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h4> Conclusion</h4>
            <p>
                This is just a short version about Machine Learning. There are tons to do research for but my main
                goal
                was get a small idea about this new era. Because I want to learn Frontend I rarely look at the new
                things or experiment with them. I’ve always thought that AI and ML are for die-hard coders. But with
                this little research I saw an opportunity to challenge myself in getting used to using new things.
