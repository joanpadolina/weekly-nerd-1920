                Focus + Passion = Impact

            <h4>
                Goal
            </h4>
            <p>
                Funda gave a workshop for the students from the minor WebDesign.
                The Workshop consisted of building a <span>features</span> with a relative large group of
                people.
                We actually looked more at the product instead of code. And importantly, don't stay at one
                problem
                and touch as much product because, you'll learn more.
                You can be more of use by a bigger variety then just one, but also for yourself, dare to
                challenger
                yourself.
                Start from the bottom, small and compact and end up big.

            <h4>Reflection workshop</h4>
            <p>
                Because the workshop was in <span>VueJs</span> and a big team for a small assignements working
                in
                Scrums. It was hard to fulfill the feature.
                We had just one hour and 30 minutes for it and that was for building and communicating with
                other
                groups. A big part of the group never
                heard of VueJS, so it was more looking it up the actually building for the case.
                But it was a challenge, for communicating with other groups and watching merge conflicts
                happening.
                <q>Total chaotic, but fun</q>
                It was short but fun case to be working with. And the group that helped us are very interesting
                to
                listen to. Very informative and calm.
